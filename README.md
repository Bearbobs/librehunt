Hello all! This is my personal project, of a website to aid you on your... libre/distro hunt!
It essentially asks you a few questions and decides which distro suits you! I plan to use Bootstrap for the CSS, Javascript, and flask+Python for the backend. Unsure on which license to use yet... but it will be 100% free software (free as in free speech)
